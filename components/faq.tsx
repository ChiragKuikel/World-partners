        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p>Currently, we assist with the following visa types:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Specified Skilled Worker Visa (SSW)</li>
            <li>Technical Intern Training Visa (TIT)</li>
          </ul>

      question: "How much does it cost to go to Japan?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          The cost varies depending on the visa type, the destination region, and the employing company. 
          Please contact us for a consultation, and we will explain the details based on your specific situation.
        </p>
      )
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the process take?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          The timeline differs depending on the visa category and timing. For example, for the SSW visa, 
          the process time varies significantly depending on whether you have already passed the Japanese language and skills exams. 
          Please consult us for an estimated timeline.
        </p>
      )
    },
    {
      question: "What documents are required?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Required documents depend on the specific visa type. Generally, you will need a passport, 
          resume (CV), graduation certificates, and photos. We will provide a specific checklist during our consultation.
        </p>
      )
    },
    {
      question: "What level of Japanese is required?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          It depends on the visa, but for the SSW visa, JLPT N4 (basic conversational level) is the minimum requirement. 
          However, having N3 or N2 will give you access to better job opportunities. We also provide support for Japanese language learning.
        </p>
      )
    },
    {
      question: "What is the salary in Japan?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Salaries vary based on the visa type, region (prefecture), and job industry. However, please be assured that all job offers 
          comply with Japanese labor laws regarding minimum wage. We will provide specific salary details when introducing job offers.

      question: "Can I bring my family (spouse/children) to Japan?",

        <p>
          Yes, if you obtain an "Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services" visa or an "SSW Type 2" visa, 
          you can bring your family to live with you. We can propose a long-term career plan if you wish to live with your family in the future.

          for the "Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services" visa. We support young talent in starting their careers.

      )
    },
    {
      question: "If I fail an interview, will you stop introducing jobs?",
