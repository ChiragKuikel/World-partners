## World Partner

*A full-stack recruitment platform built to support international hiring workflows for Nepali workers applying to jobs in Japan, developed for World Partner, a subsidiary of Glowing Partner (Japan).*

## Client Context

The client specializes in foreign nationals' employment, with a focus on connecting Nepali workers to Japanese companies. They serve both Japanese businesses seeking skilled labor and Nepali workers looking for employment opportunities in Japan.

To support their daily operations and accommodate future growth, the project required a robust and reliable digital recruitment system.

## The Challenge

Before this project, the client faced challenges such as:

- Lack of a unified recruitment platform
- Low brand visibility and trust
- Manual or fragmented workflows
- Difficulty managing data consistently

These issues made it hard to operate efficiently and grow sustainably.

## The Solution

I designed and developed a custom web application that centralizes core workflows and provides a secure, structured system for managing operations through a single platform also increasing brand visibility and trust. The solution was designed with scalability, security, and long-term maintainability in mind.

## Technology Stack

Frontend: React / Next.js 

Backend: Node.js / Express

## Security & Reliability

Security was treated as a core requirement throughout the project. The system includes secure authentication, controlled access permissions, protected environment configurations, and structured data handling to ensure reliability and safety.

## Deployment & Delivery

The application was deployed on a production shared hosting
environment using a cPanel-based setup provided by a local hosting
provider.

The backend server is configured to run within the hosting
environment, while the frontend is served as part of the deployed
application.

The system is actively running and supports real operational use.
